# openEMS (Open Energy Management System)

## About openEMS
The Open Source Energy Management System (openEMS) is a project with the scope of monitoring and optimizing the energy resources of private homes, small businesses and local administrations. The project is maintained by [GhP](http://www.ghp.tech). [Contributions](https://github.com/GhPTech/openEMS) and [suggestions](http://www.ghp.tech/#contact) are welcome.

## Architecture of openEMS
The architecture of openEMS is inspired from work carried out at [openHAB](http://www.openhab.org). It is a pure Java solution and needs a Java Virtual Machine to run on. The OSGi bundles, deployed on an OSGi framework (Equinox), provides a highly modular architecture, which allows adding and removing functionality during runtime without stopping the service.
